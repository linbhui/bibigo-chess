# Bibigo chess
**A simple chess game inspired by Bibigo products for my CJ internship application (which I obviously didn't get oopsie)**

This project is a digital representation of a real-life chess game, featuring **16 pieces per team** in the traditional layout. The key highlight is its **business-driven approach**, where <ins>product images replace standard chess pieces</ins> . The two competing teams are named **"Green"** and **"Red"**.

## Features
### Core Gameplay Mechanics
**Board & Piece System**

  - Algorithmically generated chessboard and pieces
  - Drag-and-drop functionality for moving pieces
  - Move validation based on standard chess rules (e.g., pawns move one step forward, two on their first move, and capture diagonally)
  - Conditional logic to differentiate between teammates and opponents

**Game Status & Feedback**
  - Clear player turn display for real-time tracking
  - Alerts for invalid moves to guide players
  - Automatic game end when a king is captured, followed by a restart option

**Interactive Product Integration**
  - When a piece is captured, the corresponding product is showcased on the board
  - Clickable hyperlinks allow users to learn more about each product

### Future Enhancements

I'm actively working on improving the game with:

- AI Opponent – Play against a computer-powered AI
- Customization Options – Choose and customize team pieces
- Gamified UI – A more engaging interface
- Dynamic Product Updates – Hosts can easily update chess piece products to reflect promotions, new arrivals, or seasonal items

**Overall, this project merges gameplay with marketing, offering an interactive and engaging way to showcase products in a strategic setting.
